 abstract = {In this work, we showcase a set of implemented multiplayer games and interactive installations based on Fun in Numbers (FinN). FinN allows the quick prototyping of applications that utilize input from multiple physical sources (sensors and other means of interfacing), by offering a set of programming templates and services, such as proximity, localization and synchronization, that hide the underlying complexity.},
